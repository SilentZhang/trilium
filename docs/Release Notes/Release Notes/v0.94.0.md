## üí° Key highlights

*   A [huge amount of work](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/1325) was done by @perfectra1n‚ÄÇto integrate LLMs such as Ollama and ChatGPT into Trilium.
    *   The goal is not to have basic API integration, but to really let the LLM understand the notes that are part of your knowledge base.
    *   For more information, consult the in-app User Guide (<kbd>F1</kbd>) and look for the AI section.
    *   Since this is highly experimental work, the LLM chat functionality might work well or it might have quite a few quirks, please keep this in mind.
*   This release brings significant updates to our libraries:
    *   CKEditor, used by text notes is now updated to the latest version and that brings in new features (see below) and performance improvements.
    *   CodeMirror, used by code notes has been upgraded to a new generation.
    *   Code notes now also support themes, similar to code blocks.

*   Code notes:
    *   Added the GDScript (Godot) language for both code notes and code blocks in text notes.
    *   Added the Nix language (and also in code blocks for text notes).
    *   Added an indentation marker.
    *   Note: syntax highlighting for some languages (mostly HTML-template languages such as EJS, JSP) is no longer supported due to lack of upstream support. If this is a problem, feel free to report an issue and we can see what can be done about it.
*   Added support for additional syntax highlighting for code blocks in text notes: Cypher, XML-DTD, Jinja2, ClojureScript, Perl, Scala, Scheme, Swift, SystemVerilog, mIRC, Cobol, Dylan, RPM Specfile, TCCN3.
*   Mermaid diagrams: basic syntax highlight (not all diagram types are supported) and code folding.

    *   For editable notes, clicking on a code block will reveal a toolbar with a way to easily change the programming language and another button to copy the text to clipboard.
    *   For read-only notes, a floating button allows copying the code snippet to clipboard.
