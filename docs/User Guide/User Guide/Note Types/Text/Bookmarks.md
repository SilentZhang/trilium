# Bookmarks
Bookmarks allows creating [links](Links.md) to a certain part of a note, such as referencing a particular heading.

Technically, bookmarks are HTML anchors.

This feature was introduced in TriliumNext 0.94.0.

## Interaction

*   To create a bookmark:
    *   Place the cursor at the desired position where to place the bookmark.
    *   Look for the <img src="Bookmarks_plus.png" width="15" height="16"> button in theÂ <a class="reference-link" href="Formatting%20toolbar.md">Formatting toolbar</a>, and then press the <img src="1_Bookmarks_plus.png" width="12" height="15"> button.
*   To place a link to a bookmark:
    *   Place the cursor at the desired position of the link.
    *   From the [link](Links.md) pane, select the _Bookmarks_ section and select the desired bookmark.

## Limitations

*   Currently it's not possible to create a link to a bookmark from a different note. This functionality will be added after the internal links feature is enhanced to support bookmarks.
