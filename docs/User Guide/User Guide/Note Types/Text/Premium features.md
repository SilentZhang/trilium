# Premium features
The text editor we are using for <a class="reference-link" href="../Text.md">Text</a> notes is called CKEditor and it's a commercial product. The core components are open-source, however they [offer quite a few features](https://ckeditor.com/docs/trial/latest/index.html) that require a commercial license in order to be used.

We have reached out to the CKEditor team in order to obtain a license in order to have some of these extra features and they have agreed, based on a signed agreement.

## How the license works

The license key is stored in the application and it enables the use of the previously described premium features. The license key has an expiration date which means that the features can become disabled if using an older version of the application for extended periods of time.

## Can I opt out of these features?

At this moment there is no way to disable these features, apart from manually modifying the source code. If this is a problem, [let us know](../../Troubleshooting/Reporting%20issues.md).

If you have the possibility of rebuilding the source code (e.g. if a package maintainer), then modify `VITE_CKEDITOR_KEY` in `apps/client/.env` to be `GPL`.
