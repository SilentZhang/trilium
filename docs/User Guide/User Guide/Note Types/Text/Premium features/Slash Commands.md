Slash commands is a feature of <a class="reference-link" href="../../Text.md">Text</a> notes which allows easily accessing commonly used commands simply by using the keyboard, without having to remember dedicated <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Keyboard%20Shortcuts.md">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>.

## Interaction

*   As the name suggests, to trigger the slash commands simply press the <kbd>/</kbd> key to trigger it. Note that this can be anywhere in a paragraph as long as it's not part of the word, if it doesn't show up simply press a space and press the <kbd>/</kbd> key again.
*   Use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> keys to navigate between options.
*   By default, the full list of commands is displayed.
*   To search by title or description, simply start typing for an action.
*   To trigger an action, press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

## Integration with other features

Apart from the common set of commands, some features are specially integrated with the slash commands:

*   For [admonitions](../Block%20quotes%20%26%20admonitions.md), each admonition type (e.g. note, tip) will be individually displayed.
*   Every <a class="reference-link" href="Text%20Snippets.md">Text Snippets</a> will also appear individually, making it easy to insert them.
