<p>Trilium supports creating "code" notes, i.e. notes which contain some
  sort of formal code - be it programming language (C++, JavaScript), structured
  data (JSON, XML) or other types of codes (CSS etc.).</p>
<p>This can be useful for a few things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>computer programmers can store code snippets as notes with syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>JavaScript code notes can be executed inside Trilium for some extra functionality
    <ul>
      <li>we call such JavaScript code notes "scripts" - see&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
        href="#root/_help_CdNpE2pqjmI6">Scripting</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>JSON, XML etc. can be used as storage for structured data (typically used
    in conjunction with scripting)</li>
</ul>
<p>For shorter snippets of code that can be embedded in&nbsp;<a href="#root/_help_iPIMuisry3hd">Text</a>&nbsp;notes,
  see&nbsp;<a href="#root/_help_QxEyIjRBizuC">Code blocks</a>.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the language of a code note</h2>
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>, look for the <em>Note type</em> selector
  and click it to reveal the possible note types. Inside of it there will
  be a section called <em>Code</em>, select any one of the languages.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>Adjusting the list of languages</h2>
<p>Trilium supports syntax highlighting for many languages, but by default
  displays only some of them. The supported languages can be adjusted by
  going to&nbsp;<a href="#root/_help_4TIF1oA4VQRO">Options</a>, then <em>Code Notes</em> and
  looking for the <em>Available MIME types in the dropdown</em> section. Simply
  check any of the items to add them to the list, or un-check them to remove
  them from the list.</p>
<p>Note that the list of languages is not immediately refreshed, you'd have
  to manually <a href="#root/_help_s8alTXmpFR61">refresh the application</a>.</p>
<p>The list of languages is also shared with the&nbsp;<a href="#root/_help_QxEyIjRBizuC">Code blocks</a>&nbsp;feature
  of&nbsp;<a href="#root/_help_iPIMuisry3hd">Text</a>&nbsp;notes.</p>
<h2>Color schemes</h2>
<p>Since Trilium 0.94.0 the colors of code notes can be customized by going&nbsp;
  <a
  class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_4TIF1oA4VQRO">Options</a>&nbsp;â†’ Code Notes and looking for the <em>Appearance</em> section.</p>

  <p><strong>Why are there only a few themes whereas the code block themes for text notes have a lot?</strong>
    <br>The reason is that Code notes use a different technology than the one
    used in Text notes, and as such there is a more limited selection of themes.
    If you find a CodeMirror 6 (not 5) theme that you would like to use, let
    us know and we might consider adding it to the set of default themes. There
    is no possibility of adding new themes (at least for now), since the themes
    are defined in JavaScript and not at CSS level.</p>
